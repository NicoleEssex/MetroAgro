MetroAgro

  Do you know that more than 40% of all food in America gets thrown away every year? To start chipping away at this awful reality MetroAgro puts your every neighborhood gardener in touch with anyone who wants or needs access to free fresh produce that would otherwise go to our landfills. How is works...
  After you sign in, you are able to easily select from two choices, My Bounty or Available Harvests.  The available harvests page displays all of the crops other users have added to their personal My Bounty page. You will be able to see when and where you can pick something right off the vine, or the from a portion that was set out for the taking.
  As a gardener, you are able to add your fruits, vegetables, herbs, etc., right when you plant them or wait until they are ready to harvest. Granted this feature is not up and running yet, currently when adding a crop it will automatically be posted to the Available Harvest page as well.
  There are many additional features left to be desired, for now,
1) search by individual crop
2) search by specific city or parameter to your current location
3) community blog
4) recipes that use the fresh produce you search for
5) gardening tips for fruits and vegetables you can grow in your area
  Below are screenshots for each page and available features to date.
